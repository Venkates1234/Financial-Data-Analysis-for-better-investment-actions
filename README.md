# Stock Market Analysis with Time Series Data

Time series data, a sequence of data points ordered by time, is crucial for understanding trends, patterns, and making predictions based on historical data. This repository focuses on analyzing stock market data, specifically looking at the stock prices of major technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilize `yfinance` Python library to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore and visualize different aspects of the stock prices.
- **Risk Analysis**: Explore methods to analyze the risk associated with a stock based on its historical performance.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to predict future stock prices.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-market-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stock_market_analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow along with the notebook to explore and analyze stock market data.

#Will be answering
1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks'?
5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of APPLE inc using LSTM).
