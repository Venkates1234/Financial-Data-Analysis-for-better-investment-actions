# Stock Market Analysis with Time Series Data

Time series data, a sequence of data points ordered by time, is crucial for understanding trends, patterns, and making predictions based on historical data. This repository focuses on analyzing stock market data, specifically looking at the stock prices of major technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilize `yfinance` Python library to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore and visualize different aspects of the stock prices.
- **Risk Analysis**: Explore methods to analyze the risk associated with a stock based on its historical performance.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to predict future stock prices.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-market-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stock_market_analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow along with the notebook to explore and analyze stock market data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- yfinance
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Stock Market Analysis Questions
1. Change in Stock Price Over Time
To analyze the change in price of the stock over time, we can plot the stock's closing price against time. This will give us a visual representation of how the stock price has changed over the selected time period.

2. Daily Return of the Stock on Average
The daily return of a stock can be calculated as the percentage change in the stock price from one day to the next. By calculating the average daily return over a certain period, we can get an idea of the stock's average performance on a daily basis.

3. Moving Average of Various Stocks
The moving average of a stock is calculated by taking the average of the stock's closing prices over a certain period. This helps smooth out short-term fluctuations in the stock price, making it easier to identify long-term trends.

4. Correlation Between Different Stocks
To determine the correlation between different stocks, we can calculate the correlation coefficient between their daily returns. A correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation.

5. Value at Risk by Investing in a Particular Stock
The value at risk (VaR) of a stock measures the potential loss in value of an investment over a certain period of time. It is typically calculated as the product of the stock's volatility, the investment amount, and a given confidence level.

6. Predicting Future Stock Behavior Using LSTM
To predict the future stock price of a particular stock, such as APPLE inc, we can use a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as predicting future stock prices based on past stock data.
